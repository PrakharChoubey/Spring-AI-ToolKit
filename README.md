- OpenAI Function/ToolCallbacks with Spring AI
    -
    - Used 3rd party Apis (nominatim & Api Ninjas) to retrieve the weather details
    - Configuring Function Callbacks
    - Used OpenAI Functions to format:
        - Java object/models out of 'natural language request' (using OpenAI NLP)
        - 'natural language response' out of response objects/models.
    - Used System Messages to improve Model Response.

- Spring AI Image Generation & Vision
    - DALL-E, to create/output an image from imput description (text -> Image)
     - OpenAI Vision, for vision capabilities, to output description from input image (image -> text desc.)
    - Used OpenAI Image Options, to cusomtize the model behaviour and output.
   
- Spring AI Text to Speech
    - OpenAI tts-1 model for text to speech
    - Used OpenAi Audio Speech Options to customize the model, voice, speed & response format of the speech/audio output.
